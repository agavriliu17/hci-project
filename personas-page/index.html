			<h5>Scenarios</h5>
			<p>
				<strong>Scenario 1:</strong>
                Maria goes to do some grocery shopping for her family and a couple of products she bought contained hidded milk ingredients that weren't labeled as they should. Her son is lactose intolerant, so when he ends up consuming those products, Maria had to take him to the hospital. <br>
				<strong>End point: </strong>Maria is frustrated and disappointed with the store and the product manufacturer. She feels that the store should have provided better information about the product.        
            </p> <br>
            <p>
				<strong>Scenario 2:</strong>
                Maria wants to buy some products from the store, and uses the 'begr' app to see risks abour the products she scans, and get better products based on prices and risks. She ends up buying the other items. <br>
                <strong>End point: </strong>Maria is happy that she managed to find good products at affordable prices, and that she could avoid buying products that could harm her son or any other family member.
